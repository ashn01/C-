1. After B+=E in cpp file, A and D are replaced with result of it.
when it returns wrong value as an example, B contains right value but A and D contains the wrong value.

2. compiler casts it as an Fraction because Fraction class has constructor that takes 2 integer arguments. But second argument is 1 if this constructor takes one argument. So, B+3 is B + Fraction(3).

3. I've learned to use operator and how to return itself ,for example , return *this;.
