1. Namespace is an area including funtions, variables. It prevents crash when many library is included. It also indicates that where a function is belonged.

2. When a function in a.cpp needs to use another function in b.cpp, a.cpp needs information about b.cpp. Then, calling function can know function's template such as parameters, return type. All these information are declared in header files. It also makes better performance. Because compiler doesn't have to read all code which is written in cpp file.
