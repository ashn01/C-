This is what I have done in OOP244 class.

There are 5 milestones folder starting with m, and 10 workshops folder starting with w.

For the milestones, I developed a Point Of Sales program. From milestone 1 to 5, I added several modules, and finally created a POS program.

Each workshops, I learnt concept of OOP, virtual function, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to complete milestones.
